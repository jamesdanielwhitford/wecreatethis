I need a new button on the birdle homepage called life
  list, this is a list of all the birds the user has seen
  throughout their life, arranged into continents and
  regions within those continents and also for each brd
  they have seen it should have like a nu,ber of
  sightings on the right side of the name in the list the
  list must be like the search page's formatting but
  with like regions and states/provinces as subsections
  like the rarity sections in the game page and eahc bird
  must have a detail view with number of sightings and a
  location and date for first sighting. the game page
  and the search both have ways of logging sightings this
  should also trigger a life list addition etc 

  but now I think of it we need a system for caching birds in this app like for example, all birds in a current open game should be cached, the top 100 most recently viewed birds in the search should be cached, viewed means the detail view was opened, any bird with a teacked sighting must be cached, if a bird is seen in the search area, the user must be gven the option to give the sighting a date and area then the app will know whether to update any current games that that sighting is applicable to. also we need a number of sightings data in the cached bird data

  also we need in all bird detail pages a link to google the birds name this is across the game search and life list parts of the app

  and we must make sure birds dont get cached twice like if they are already cached, and where are they being cached? maybe we should use indexdb across the app?
