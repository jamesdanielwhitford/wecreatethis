First when adding a sighting I think we need to give an option of using the precise location the user is in, or the current thing which is country and region we have that already, and maybe an option to use the map when online to choose a location on the map when online 

I want to add trips on the homepage of birdle

The trips will basically be a filter for birds based on time spotted and/or area spotted

These are birding trips the user can set 

The list of trips is the same UI as the bird bingo game list page 

When making a trip we set the time of the trip, if choosing a time a start time is required, an end time isn’t required, but later the user should be able to end the trip 

The user can also set an area for the trip, this will use a map to set an area that the trip will take place in

Maybe areas should only be available to choose when online, well at least when using a map, otherwise when offline maybe only an option to choose region and country when offline because I think the map we are using is an online only option 

The user can set time, area, or both

Then birds captured during that time, or area, or both, are added to the trip

The trip detail page should be just like a list of the birds like the search page or life list page and maybe a number of sightings that took place in that time, area or both

Then some settings in the top right of the nav at to end or delete a trip, maybe to resume, or edit the date, time area etc like even if the user made it a area trip and later they can add an area, etc basically these trips are just filters
