Beautiful mind main page should be only folders, any notes created that were not created in a folder should be added to a folder called stray notes 

Now there are 2 folder types, a folder and a book 

Inside a book the first page a user should see is the table of contents clicking a heading or subheading in the table of contents will navigate to that note

But within a book now navigation is a little different. A book is made up of many notes, but the notes are kind of indistinguishable. They flow like the content of a book, say the user made a text not then added an image, these in the backend are two different notes but when rendered in the book view the image with just appear below the note.

Books will be read like pages and navigated with a kindle like UI. Only enough content will appear on a page as can fit within the page height. To go the next page the user taps the right side of the screen and the left to go back etc.

When adding some text, if. # is used this creates a new text note, with what comes after the # as a heading for the note that will appear in the table of contents that text note will continue until the user adds maybe another # heading or an image or voice note etc those are treated as new notes 

But remember a ## or ### doesn’t start a new note after a # but it would start a new note after an image for example 


That was a book type. A folder will remain the way it works currently in beautifulmind for now
